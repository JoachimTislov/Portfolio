  intro: `I am 22 year old male from Sandnes with a passion for programming.`,
  about: [
    `I live with my Alaskan husky - Leo, 
      I love programming, gaming, sports and the process of solving a problem. I Played football for over 14 years, 
      which provided me with extensive team-building skills.`,

    `I got access to technology at a fairly young age, but it wasn't until highschool I started to learn coding. 
    I remember creating a simple website with six boxes and I was tasked to present them in a 2x3 format. I didn't
    watch any tutorials and spent multiple hours before I eventually managed to style the website correctly, and remember
    running down to my parents and showing them my website with utmost pride.`,

    `This task, among many others, is what sparked my interest in programming. The combination of tackling challenges with patience and intellectual or creative thinking, 
    along with developing applications and systems, offers an all-in-one package that I find compelling.`

  keywords: `Patient, dedicated and persistent`,
  situation: `I am currently working on personal projects, and plan to integrate every project into
        the website. This allows you to explore and interact with them, rather just reading
        about each project. `,

      intro: `During my summer holiday, my father and brother played four in a row. After hearing my brother lose
                for the 7th time, I thought; "Why not program a bot for him to play against?".`,

        `- Creating an intelligent bot combining both simple and advanced algorithms, making it unbeatable.`,

        `This is still ongoing, since it is in fact beatable. I am currently having issues with the core design of my algorithms;
                scan the board, check for three and two in a row, mark losing choices, filter out awful choices 
                and in the end determine the optimal choice among the remaining options.`,

        `That was the process in a nutshell. There are many more pieces to the puzzle.`

        `The website's structure is composed of an authentication system, primarily to identify players and distinguish them as different individuals.
                Then we have the join and create lobby alternatives, players can join public lobbies or create their own lobby which features customizable options including the Oracle, 
                image choice, amount of rounds, game mode and more.`,
        `The game is straightforward: the Oracle of the game reveals parts of the image and the guessers
                write their guesses in the chat until a player guesses correctly.`,

        `The application is synchronized using SignalR, enabling players to interact in real-time. The Oracle of the game choose which image tiles to reveal, 
                and if its AI or, in other words; an algorithm, then it determines which tiles to reveal when the leader of the lobby decides to do so.`,

        `The development period was roughly two months. I experienced programming an application in a group for the first time. It was quite challenging,
                 considering I did'nt have full control over the project and could'nt just implement everything; So I adapted my work in relation to the group.`
